# foundations.yaml
# Shared capabilities required across 3+ engagement models.
# These are "build regardless of direction" requirements — any
# product addressing ADHD workplace problems needs them.
#
# Foundations represent the strongest "what to build with high
# confidence" recommendations in the system.
#
# Technical detail (approaches, tradeoffs, accelerators) is in
# technologies.yaml. Foundations point to technology entries via
# technology_ref. Foundations describe WHY something is needed;
# technologies.yaml describes HOW it could be built.

Calendar Integration:
  id: FDN01
  technology_ref: TECH_01
  required_by:
    required: [M1, M2, M4, M5, M6, M7]
    optional: [M3, M8]
  purpose: >
    Knowing what the user should be working on, when meetings
    are, and where time conflicts exist. Used for context in
    interventions (M1), resurfacing timing (M2), time-aware
    reordering (M4), conflict detection (M5), injection timing
    (M6), and check-in content (M7).

Task Tool Integration:
  id: FDN02
  technology_ref: TECH_02
  required_by:
    required: [M1, M4, M6, M7]
    optional: [M2, M8]
  purpose: >
    Read access to task lists from external tools. Some models
    (M4, M6) also need write access to reorder or inject tasks.
    No universal task API exists — each platform requires
    separate integration.

Non-Shaming Tone and Language Framework:
  id: FDN03
  required_by:
    required: [M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M7, M8]
    optional: []
  purpose: >
    Any user-facing text must follow ADHD-appropriate tone
    guidelines. This is not a feature — it is a constraint on
    every surface that generates or displays text. Includes AI-
    generated content (nudges, summaries, scaffolds, prompts).
  note: >
    Design constraint, not a technology area. No technology_ref.
    Implementation is through prompt engineering, content review
    processes, and tone guidelines applied to all AI-generated
    output.

Variability Engine:
  id: FDN04
  technology_ref: TECH_09
  required_by:
    required: [M1, M2, M4, M5, M6, M7]
    optional: []
  note: M3 and M8 are episodic/on-demand and exempt
  purpose: >
    Required by MC1 (Novelty Decay) as a universal
    architectural requirement. Any model that delivers recurring
    interventions must vary what it does, when, and how. This is
    not a feature — it is an architectural requirement affecting
    the entire notification and delivery pipeline.
  claims: [C022, C024, C025]

On-Device Processing:
  id: FDN05
  technology_ref: TECH_04
  required_by:
    required: [M1, M2, M6]
    optional: [M3, M4, M5, M7, M8]
  purpose: >
    Privacy-critical for models that monitor activity (M1),
    read communications (M2), or access project tools broadly
    (M6). On-device processing prevents sensitive work data
    from leaving the user's machine.

MCP Integration Backbone:
  id: FDN06
  technology_ref: TECH_03
  required_by:
    required: [M1, M2, M4, M6]
    optional: [M3, M5, M7, M8]
  purpose: >
    Standardised tool connectivity. Reduces the N-by-M
    integration problem to N MCP servers. Essential for
    multi-channel capture (M2) and multi-tool project
    monitoring (M6).

Knowledge Graph and Structured Memory:
  id: FDN07
  technology_ref: TECH_05
  required_by:
    required: [M2, M6]
    optional: [M4, M5]
  purpose: >
    Automatic entity extraction and relationship mapping from
    unstructured text. Enables contextual resurfacing, multi-
    hop reasoning, and compound value over time. The primary
    defence against MC1 (Novelty Decay) through compounding
    switching cost.
